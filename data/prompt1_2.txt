Generate 99 JSONL entries, starting from the second entry, based on this first entry:

{"word": "ideas", "english": "Fresh ideas spark creative breakthroughs.", "thai": "แนวคิดใหม่จุดประกายความก้าวหน้าทางความคิดสร้างสรรค์"}

For the second entry, select a random English word (excluding "trust" and "ideas") from the first entry's English sentence as the `word` field, matching exactly (e.g., "balance" ≠ "balancing"). For each subsequent entry, select a random English word (excluding the previous entry's `word`) from the previous entry's English sentence, following this chaining rule. Prefer words supporting English fluency (avoid simple words like "the" unless part of a phrase).

Each entry must follow this JSONL format:
{"word": "pen", "english": "This pen costs five dollars.", "thai": "ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

Use motivational English sentences across these themes: Perseverance, Resilience, Determination, Courage, Self-Belief, Growth, Ambition, Passion, Optimism, Hope, Confidence, Discipline, Focus, Commitment, Hard Work, Success, Achievement, Leadership, Teamwork, Collaboration, Creativity, Innovation, Adaptability, Patience, Grit, Vision, Purpose, Dedication, Empowerment, Inspiration, Integrity, Honesty, Gratitude, Kindness, Empathy, Generosity, Positivity, Strength, Endurance, Balance, Mindfulness, Self-Improvement, Learning, Wisdom, Curiosity, Exploration, Adventure, Freedom, Authenticity, Bravery, Tenacity, Motivation, Drive, Aspiration, Clarity, Unity, Respect, Responsibility, Accountability, Progress, Transformation, Overcoming Obstacles, Self-Discipline, Consistency, Effort, Opportunity, Potential, Excellence, Mastery, Skill, Talent, Joy, Happiness, Fulfillment, Contentment, Peace, Harmony, Support, Encouragement, Belief, Faith, Boldness, Initiative, Action, Change, Impact, Influence, Legacy, Contribution, Service, Community, Connection, Belonging, Acceptance, Self-Love, Triumph.

If unique words are exhausted, reuse words only after all eligible words are used, respecting exclusion rules.

Output all 99 entries in a single JSONL code block, one entry per line, excluding the first entry.

After generating, ask: "Continue with another 99 JSONL entries, using the last entry as the first for the new batch, excluding it to avoid duplication? Respond with 'y' for yes or 'n' for no."

If "y", generate the next 99 entries, repeating for each "y" response.
