Generate 99 JSONL entries, starting from the second entry, using the provided first entry:
{"word":"{word}","english":"{english_sentence}","thai":"{thai_translation}"}

For the second entry, select a random English word (excluding the first entry's `word` and "ideas") from the first entry's English sentence as the `word` field, ensuring it appears exactly as written in the new English sentence. For each subsequent entry, select a random English word (excluding the previous entry's `word`) from the previous entry's English sentence as the `word` field, ensuring it appears exactly as written in the new English sentence, strictly adhering to this chaining rule. Treat words strictly (e.g., "balance" ≠ "balancing", "organize" ≠ "organizing").

Each entry must follow this JSONL format:
{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

To ensure natural, conversational language and diversity:
- Use words from the 5,000 most frequent in spoken American English (e.g., COCA spoken corpus), prioritizing everyday words in casual, slang, idiomatic, or academic contexts (e.g., "cool," "stuff," "get," "discuss," "approach").
- Include phrasal verbs (e.g., "pick up," "check out," "run into") in at least 50% of English sentences.
- Cover 99 unique themes reflecting everyday American life (e.g., coffee shops, texting, workplace, PhD seminars, home, travel, hobbies, technology, food, emotions, shopping, health, sports, music, relationships, weather, culture, science, art, gaming, social media, environment, education, finance, daily routines, holidays, fitness, pets, cooking, movies, community events, volunteering, dining out, parenting, adventure, photography, festivals, spirituality, career changes, sustainability, mental health, teamwork, entrepreneurship, local businesses, personal achievements, time management, relaxation, networking, charity, board games, stargazing).
- Write natural, conversational English sentences using casual expressions (e.g., "What's up?"), slang (e.g., "That's dope!"), idioms (e.g., "Spill the beans"), or academic phrasing (e.g., "This framework challenges conventional methodologies") as appropriate.
- Provide accurate, natural Thai translations matching the English sentence's tone (e.g., colloquial Thai for slang, formal Thai for academic contexts).
- Strictly ensure the selected `word` exists exactly as written in the previous entry's English sentence to maintain the chaining rule, avoiding manual corrections.
- Avoid repetitive sentence structures and minimize word reuse across entries (except for chaining), prioritizing diverse, high-frequency vocabulary.

Output all 99 entries in a single JSONL code block, one entry per line, excluding the first entry.

After generating the batch, ask: "Would you like to continue with the next batch of 99 JSONL entries using the last entry of this batch as the first entry? Please respond with 'y' for yes or 'n' for no."

If I respond with "y", generate the next batch of 99 JSONL entries using the last entry of the previous batch as the first entry, following the same rules. Continue this process for subsequent batches when I respond with "y".
