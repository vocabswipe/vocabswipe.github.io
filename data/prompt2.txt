Use the last entry from the previously generated JSONL code block as the first entry for this series.

Generate a series of 99 entries in JSONL format, starting with the second entry. For the second entry, select a random content word (noun, verb, adjective, or adverb, excluding function words like "is," "the," "of") from the first entry's English sentence to include in the new sentence. For each subsequent entry, select a random content word from the previous entry's English sentence to include in the new sentence. To maximize vocabulary diversity, prefer words that differ significantly in meaning or context from the previous entry’s word and avoid repeating words already used as the "word" field in earlier entries (including those from the previous 99 entries).

Each entry must follow this exact JSONL format:
{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

Ensure all English sentences:
- Reflect everyday spoken American English, varying in tone (casual, formal, informal, slang, idiomatic) and context (e.g., daily life, work, emotions, technology, culture, hobbies, travel, relationships, food, sports, etc.).
- Are natural, conversational, and concise (1-10 words).
- Incorporate the selected word naturally in a new sentence.

Ensure Thai translations are accurate, natural, and match the tone of the English sentence. Avoid repetitive sentence structures or themes by exploring diverse topics and expressions. Output all 99 entries in sequence as a single JSONL code block, with each entry on a new line. Do not include the first entry in the output. Verify that no "word" field repeats across entries to ensure vocabulary diversity.
