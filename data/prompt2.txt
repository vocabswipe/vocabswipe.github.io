Generate 99 JSONL entries, starting from the second entry, using the last entry of a previous JSONL series as the first entry.

For the second entry, select a random English word (excluding the first entry's `word`) from the first entry's English sentence as the `word` field, ensuring it appears in the new entry's English sentence. For each subsequent entry, select a random English word (excluding the previous entry's `word`) from the previous entry's English sentence as the `word` field, ensuring it appears in the new entry's English sentence.

Each entry must follow this JSONL format:
{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

To ensure diversity and avoid repetition:
- Use varied vocabulary, minimizing word reuse across entries unless required by the chaining rule.
- Include phrasal verbs common in American English (e.g., "pick up," "turn out," "give up") in at least 50% of English sentence fields.
- Vary sentence contexts (e.g., home, work, school, travel, hobbies, technology, food, emotions, slang, idioms, formal/informal speech).
- Write natural, conversational English sentences reflecting everyday American English, mixing casual, formal, slang, and idiomatic expressions.
- Provide accurate, natural Thai translations matching the tone of the English sentence (e.g., formal Thai for formal English, casual Thai for slang).
- Verify the selected `word` exists in the previous entry's English sentence.
- Avoid repetitive sentence structures (e.g., not overusing "This [word] is [adjective]").

Output all 99 entries in sequence as a single JSONL code block, each entry on a new line, excluding the first entry.
