Generate 99 JSONL entries, starting from the second entry, using the last entry of a previous JSONL series as the first entry.

For the second entry, select a random English word (excluding the first entry's `word`) from the first entry's English sentence as the `word` field, ensuring it appears in the new entry's English sentence. For each subsequent entry, select a random English word (excluding the previous entry's `word`) from the previous entry's English sentence as the `word` field, ensuring it appears in the new entry's English sentence.

Each entry must follow this JSONL format:
{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

To ensure diversity and avoid repetition:
- Use varied vocabulary, minimizing word reuse across entries unless required by the chaining rule.
- Include phrasal verbs common in American English (e.g., "pick up," "turn out," "give up") in at least 20% of English sentence fields.
- Vary sentence contexts across 100 distinct themes (e.g., home, work, school, travel, hobbies, technology, food, emotions, slang, idioms, formal/informal speech, shopping, health, sports, music, relationships, weather, culture, history, science, art, fashion, gaming, social media, environment, politics, education, finance, travel destinations, daily routines, holidays, transportation, fitness, pets, gardening, cooking, movies, books, celebrations, technology trends, workplace dynamics, urban life, rural life, childhood memories, future aspirations, personal growth, community events, volunteering, outdoor activities, dining out, home improvement, parenting, retirement, adventure, photography, language learning, festivals, architecture, spirituality, fitness goals, career changes, online learning, virtual reality, sustainability, mental health, teamwork, leadership, entrepreneurship, travel planning, cultural traditions, seasonal activities, local businesses, global issues, personal achievements, time management, relaxation, networking, charity, hobbies like knitting or painting, car maintenance, public speaking, social gatherings, academic research, creative writing, fitness challenges, pet adoption, home organization, minimalism, digital nomad lifestyle, thrift shopping, board games, stargazing).
- Write natural, conversational English sentences reflecting everyday American English, mixing casual, formal, slang, and idiomatic expressions.
- Provide accurate, natural Thai translations matching the tone of the English sentence (e.g., formal Thai for formal English, casual Thai for slang).
- Verify the selected `word` exists in the previous entry's English sentence.
- Avoid repetitive sentence structures (e.g., not overusing "This [word] is [adjective]").

Output all 99 entries in sequence as a single JSONL code block, each entry on a new line, excluding the first entry.
