Use the last entry from the previously generated JSONL code block as the first entry for this series. The last entry is provided as:
{"word": "[last_word]", "english": "[last_english_sentence]", "thai": "[last_thai_translation]"}

Generate a series of 99 entries in JSONL format, starting with the second entry. For the second entry, select a random English word from the first entry’s English sentence (excluding common function words like "is", "the", "of", "with", etc.) to use as the `word` field and create a new sentence featuring that word. For each subsequent entry, select a random English word from the previous entry’s English sentence (excluding common function words) to use as the `word` field and create a new sentence featuring that word. Each entry must follow this exact JSONL format:
{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

**Requirements:**
- **Sentence Length and Complexity**: Each English sentence must be 8–15 words long to provide a larger pool of words for selection, ensuring complexity and variety.
- **Vocabulary Diversity**: Avoid reusing words from previous entries as the `word` field unless absolutely necessary (e.g., after exhausting other options). Prioritize unique nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.
- **Context and Theme Variety**: Sentences must span a wide range of themes and contexts, such as technology, travel, education, sports, business, entertainment, nature, relationships, health, culture, slang-heavy casual dialogue, formal discussions, idiomatic expressions, or everyday scenarios. Explicitly choose a unique theme or context for each sentence to avoid clustering around similar topics (e.g., home, food, cozy settings).
- **Language Style**: English sentences must reflect varied spoken American English, including casual, formal, informal, slang, or idiomatic expressions, matching the chosen context (e.g., slang for casual dialogue, formal tone for business contexts).
- **Thai Translations**: Thai translations must be accurate, natural, and reflect the same tone and context as the English sentence (e.g., formal Thai for formal contexts, colloquial Thai for casual sentences).
- **Word Selection**: When selecting a word from the previous sentence, prioritize content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) that inspire a new, distinct theme or context for the next sentence.

Output all 99 entries (2 to 99) in sequence as a single JSONL code block, with each entry on a new line. Do not include the first entry in the output.
