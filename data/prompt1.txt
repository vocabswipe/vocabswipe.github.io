Generate a series of 99 entries in JSONL format, starting with the second entry, based on the first entry:

{"word": "ideas", "english": "Creative ideas spark vibrant change.", "thai": "แนวคิดสร้างสรรค์จุดประกายการเปลี่ยนแปลงที่มีชีวิตชีวา"}

For the second entry, select a random English word (excluding the first entry's `word`, "ideas") from the first entry's English sentence ("Creative ideas spark vibrant change.") to be the `word` field, ensuring it appears in the new entry's English sentence. For each subsequent entry, select a random English word (excluding the previous entry's `word`) from the previous entry's English sentence to be the `word` field, ensuring it appears in the new entry's English sentence.

Each entry must follow this JSONL format:
{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

To ensure natural, conversational language and diversity:
- Select words from the 5,000 most frequently used in spoken American English (e.g., based on corpora like COCA spoken section), prioritizing everyday words used in casual, slang, idiomatic, or academic contexts (e.g., "cool," "stuff," "get," "discuss," "approach").
- Include phrasal verbs common in spoken American English (e.g., "pick up," "check out," "run into") in at least 50% of English sentences.
- Vary sentence contexts across 99 distinct themes reflecting everyday American life, including casual settings (e.g., coffee shops, texting, hanging out), workplace interactions, academic discussions (e.g., PhD seminars, research critiques), and diverse scenarios (e.g., home, school, travel, hobbies, technology, food, emotions, slang, shopping, health, sports, music, relationships, weather, culture, science, art, gaming, social media, environment, education, finance, daily routines, holidays, fitness, pets, cooking, movies, community events, volunteering, dining out, parenting, adventure, photography, festivals, spirituality, career changes, sustainability, mental health, teamwork, entrepreneurship, local businesses, personal achievements, time management, relaxation, networking, charity, board games, stargazing).
- Write English sentences that are natural, conversational, and reflect spoken American English, using a mix of casual expressions (e.g., "How's it going?"), slang (e.g., "That's dope!"), idioms (e.g., "Spill the beans"), and academic phrasing (e.g., "This framework challenges conventional methodologies").
- Ensure Thai translations are accurate, natural, and match the tone of the English sentence (e.g., colloquial Thai for slang, formal Thai for academic contexts).
- Strictly verify the selected `word` exists in the previous entry's English sentence to maintain the chaining rule.
- Avoid repetitive sentence structures (e.g., do not overuse "This [word] is [adjective]") and ensure varied syntax reflecting natural speech patterns.
- Minimize word reuse across entries unless required by the chaining rule, prioritizing diverse, high-frequency vocabulary.

Output all 99 entries in sequence as a single JSONL code block, with each entry on a new line. Do not include the first entry.
