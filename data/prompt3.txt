Modify the second entry in the following JSONL sequence to fix the error where the word "time" in the second entry does not appear in the first entry's English sentence: "Counting ballots took longer than expected." The sequence is:

{"word":"ballots","english":"Counting ballots took longer than expected.","thai":"การนับคะแนนใช้เวลานานกว่าที่คาด"}
{"word":"time","english":"Time flew by during the lively party.","thai":"เวลาผ่านไปเร็วมากในงานปาร์ตี้ที่คึกคัก"}
{"word":"party","english":"The costume party was a spooky success.","thai":"งานปาร์ตี้ชุดแฟนซีประสบความสำเร็จอย่างน่าขนลุก"}

Replace the word "time" in the second entry with a random word from the first entry's English sentence ("counting", "ballots", "took", "longer", "expected"). Ensure the new English sentence in the second entry includes both the selected word and the word "party". Update the Thai translation to match the new English sentence, ensuring it is accurate, natural, and reflects the same tone. Maintain the JSONL format:

{"word":"pen","english":"This pen costs five dollars.","thai":"ปากกานี้ราคาห้าดอลลาร์"}

Provide the corrected second entry as a single JSONL line.
