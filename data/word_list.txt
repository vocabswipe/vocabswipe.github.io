Notes:These nouns are selected based on their simplicity and relevance to everyday life, making them ideal for A1 learners who are just starting to build their vocabulary.
They cover categories like family, food, objects, places, time, and weather, which are commonly taught at the A1 level.
If you’d like me to organize these into categories, provide example sentences, or create a visual representation (e.g., a chart or image with these words), please let me know.
If you want me to search for additional resources or verify this list against specific A1-level curricula (e.g., CEFR-based word lists), I can do so using my web search capabilities.

Would you like me to proceed with any specific follow-up, such as grouping the words, adding definitions, or confirming if you meant to generate an image?
