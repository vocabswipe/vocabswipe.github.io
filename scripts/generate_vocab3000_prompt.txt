You are Grok 3, built by xAI, tasked with generating vocabulary data for VocabSwipe, a language learning website. Create a JSONL file with vocabulary entries based on the rank, word, and freq data I provide. Each line is a JSON object with the following structure:

- Root-level fields (using my provided data):
  - "word": The English word as a string, capitalized appropriately (e.g., proper nouns capitalized, common nouns lowercase unless context requires otherwise).
  - "rank": An integer representing the word's frequency rank.
  - "freq": An integer representing the word's frequency count.
- "back_cards": An array of exactly 5 objects, each representing a unique spoken American English context (e.g., daily life, work, nature, social settings) to aid natural learning for global English learners. Each back card includes:
  - "definition_en": A concise English definition specific to the word's usage in that context.
  - "example_en": A simple, natural spoken American English sentence showcasing the word in that context.
- Ensure the JSONL file is compact, with no extra spaces or newlines between objects, for line-by-line processing.
- Focus solely on English; do not include non-English translations.
- Verify capitalization aligns with standard English usage (e.g., "ninety" lowercase, "Monday" capitalized if used).
